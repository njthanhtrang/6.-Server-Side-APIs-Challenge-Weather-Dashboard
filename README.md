# 6.-Server-Side-APIs-Challenge-Weather-Dashboard
## Description 

​This application will allow travelers to plan their trips according to the weather forecast by providing the weather outlook for multiple cities. This weather dashboard runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS to retrieve weather data from the OpenWeather One Call API.

 When searching for a city, the user is presented with current and future conditions for that city which includes the city name, date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, wind speed, and color-coded UV index indicating whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. The 5-day forecast displays the date, icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, wind conditions, and humidity for each following day. When clicking on a city in the search history, the user is again presented with current and future conditions for that city. localStorage stores persistent data and is cleared upon clicking the "Clear" button.

Future implementations include treating the input form to allow the user to press "enter" to submit their city.

​
Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
​
## Features
​
If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.
​
## Contributing
​
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.
​
## Tests
​
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
