# 6.-Server-Side-APIs-Challenge-Weather-Dashboard
## Description 

​This application will allow travelers to plan their trips according to the weather forecast by providing the weather outlook for multiple cities. This weather dashboard runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS to retrieve weather data from the OpenWeather One Call API.

 When searching for a city, the user is presented with current and future conditions for that city which includes the city name, date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, wind speed, and color-coded UV index indicating whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. The 5-day forecast displays the date, icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, wind conditions, and humidity for each following day. When clicking on a city in the search history, the user is again presented with current and future conditions for that city. localStorage stores persistent data and is cleared upon clicking the "Clear" button.

Future implementations include treating the input form to allow the user to press "enter" to submit their city.
